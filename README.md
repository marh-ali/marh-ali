I'm a software engineer with a strong foundation in backend development and a dedication to continuous learning. During my Master's program at Georgetown University, I took a gap year to hone my skills through a 9-month, full-time Backend Development course co-developed by Amazon and BloomTech. This immersive experience provided me with proficiency in Java, object-oriented programming, API development, and AWS applications.

Now, as a software engineer, I focus on creating cutting-edge solutions that are practical and impactful. I am driven by a love for embracing challenges and creating meaningful change in the technology space.
