### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Ali, an experienced leader with 3+ years of experience facilitating complex, high-stake projects across different teams and in a fast-paced policy environment. Recently, I have contributed to backend development projects using Java, AWS applications,  object-oriented programming, API development, and best coding standards (tech stack). I have also been able to draw on my strong fundamentals in data structures and algorithms to optimize an array of enterprise web application services. 

As a graduate student in Georgetown Universityâ€™s Security Studies Program, I decided to further pursue a new passion for software engineering by taking 9 months off from my degree to complete a full-time Backend Development course co-developed by Amazon and BloomTech (fka Lambda School). I look forward to exploring career opportunities where my unique professional experience, academic credentials, and development skills will enhance team productivity and product scalability.

ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack:

Backend: Java, Python, C++,  AWS (DynamoDB, Lambda, API Gateway, E2, S3, IAM, CloudFormation), Spring Boot, SQL, Mockito, Dagger 
Frontend: React, ReactNative, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Additional: Git CLI, database fundamentals, service-oriented architecture, design patterns, testing, debugging, deployment, algorithmic analysis
