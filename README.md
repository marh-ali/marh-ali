Seasoned policy professional turned software engineer, my career embodies a unique blend of national security experience and technical acumen. After spearheading complex national-level projects at the Crown Prince's Office in Bahrain (now the PMO), I pivoted to software engineering, fueled by a passion for innovation and taking up new challenges. 

During a Master's gap year at Georgetown University's Security Studies Program, I honed my skills through a 9-month, full-time Backend Development course co-developed by Amazon and BloomTech. I gained proficiency in Java, object-oriented programming, API development, and AWS applications.

Now, I leverage my diverse skillset working on cutting-edge software projects while remaining engaged in national security issues in Washington DC, bridging the gap between policy and technology. My policy background enriches my software solutions, making them practical and impactful. I am driven by a love for embracing challenges and creating meaningful change.
